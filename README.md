# Cyber Security Base Project 1 

This is a simple Django-based message board built as part of the course [Cyber Security Base 2025](https://cybersecuritybase.mooc.fi/module-3.1) at University of Helsinki. 

The project demonstrates common security flaws from the [OWASP Top 10](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/) list and includes basic implementations of each vulnerability.
